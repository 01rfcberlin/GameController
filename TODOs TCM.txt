- fix bugs
  - when replaying a log the first seconds are skipped
- begin / end recording logs when GameController is in ready / finished state
- better replaying of logfiles:
  - controls in a seperate always-on-top window
  - fast forward
  - rewind (?)
- display details about illegal messages
- visualize more B-Human messages (debug drawings?)
