* fix bugs
  - under some circumstances a team can be both left and right team
  - log file replaying hangs at the end of the log after fast forwarding
* display details about illegal messages
* better replaying of logfiles:
  - controls in a seperate always-on-top window
  - fast forward
  - rewind (?)
* complete JavaDoc (again)
* visualize more B-Human messages (debug drawings?)
