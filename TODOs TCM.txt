* fix bugs
* display details about illegal messages
* begin / end recording logs when GameController is in ready / finished state
* better replaying of logfiles:
  - controls in a seperate always-on-top window
  - fast forward
  - rewind (?)
* complete JavaDoc (again)
* visualize more B-Human messages (debug drawings?)
